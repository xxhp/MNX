		<h2>FAQ</h2>
		<h3>What is MNX?</h3>
		<p>MNX is a utility to help you download data from your <a href="http://www.mainnav.com/">Mainnav</a> GPS devices. It also help you to view the content of the downloaded activities, and export them into various formats including GPX, KML and TCX.</p>
		<p>For furthor imformation about Mainnav's GPS devices, please visit Mainnav Technology Corp's website: <a href="http://www.mainnav.com/"> http://www.mainnav.com/</a></p>
		<h3>What doesn't MNX do?</h3>		
		<p>MNX does not keep all your sport activities. The stored data on your Mac will be replaced by new one each time you download data from your device. MNX is not your training data center, but you can export the activities, and then use your training data management softwares to import them, or use online services such as <a href="http://runkeeper.com/" title="RunKeeper">RunKeeper</a>, <a href="http://www.endomondo.com/" title="Endomondo">Endomondo</a>, etc.</p>
		<h3>Why I cannot use features like POI list of my Mainnav device with MNX?</h3>
		<p>MNX is not developed by Mainnav, it is based on the reverse engineering of the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/mainnav-reader/">mainnav-reader project</a>. Mainnav reader is quite good for users who don't use Windows platform, but I developed MNX, because I like to have a GUI software.</p>
		<p>Since Mainnav does not have an open document about how to communicate with the GPS devices, I am unable to complete all the features.</p>
		<h3>Which devices are supported?</h3>
		<p>I have tested MNX with my Mainnav MG-600. I do not have other models yet, if MNX works with your device or not, please let me know via GitHub's <a href="https://github.com/zonble/MNX/issues">issue-tracker system</a>.</p>
