		<h2>FAQ</h2>
		<h3>What is MNX?</h3>
		<p>MNX is a utility to help you download data from your <a href="http://www.mainnav.com/">Mainnav</a> GPS devices. It also help you to view the content of the downloaded activities, and export them into various formats including GPX, KML and TCX.</p>
		<p>For furthor imformation about Mainnav's GPS devices, please visit <a href="http://www.mainnav.com/">Mainnav Technology Corp's website</a>.</p>
		<h3>What doesn't MNX do?</h3>
		<p>MNX is not a sport tracking software. It does not calculate the calories you burn, it does not record your weight and BMI, and it does not sync the data between your computers as well. Its performance on saving and loading sport activities is also not so good, it is not a good idea to store many activies within MNX.</p>
		<p>What MNX offers is to read data from the GPS devices, and let you to export these data to other softwares, or upload to exsiting great web services such as <a href="http://connect.garmin.com/">Garmin Connect</a>, <a href="http://www.everytrail.com">EveryTrail</a>, <a href="http://runkeeper.com/" title="RunKeeper">RunKeeper</a>, <a href="http://www.endomondo.com/" title="Endomondo">Endomondo</a>, etc. Actually web services do such a job better than desktop applications.</p>
		<h3>Why I cannot use features like POI list of my Mainnav device with MNX?</h3>
		<p>MNX is not developed by Mainnav, it is based on the reverse engineering of the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/mainnav-reader/">mainnav-reader project</a>. Mainnav reader is quite good for users who don't use Windows platform, but I developed MNX, because I like to have a GUI software.</p>
		<p>Since Mainnav does not have an open document about how to communicate with the GPS devices, I am unable to complete all the features.</p>
		<h3>Which devices are supported?</h3>
		<p>I have tested MNX with my Mainnav MG-600. I do not have other models yet, if MNX works with your device or not, please let me know via GitHub's <a href="https://github.com/zonble/MNX/issues">issue-tracker system</a>.</p>
